                <p>Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we're committed
                    to making science accessible to all.
                    Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
                    understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything 
                    from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.</p>
                    
                    <hr>

                    <p>The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience
                         the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion 
                         to continue the exploration of the world around us.
                        We believe science should not be confined to the textbook,
                         but brought to live through exhibits.</p>

                         <p> This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied 
                            subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed 
                            for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life 
                            (apart from the dinosaur exhibits - they only come to life at night when 
                            everyone's gone home).</p>

                            <h3>Evolution</h3> 
                            For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins.
                            Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of 
                            evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today 
                            have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures 
                            who didn't survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

                            <h3>Biology and Medicine</h3>
                            From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology 
                            are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
                            For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of
                            life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine.
                            Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a 
                            look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and 
                            the first heart transplant.
                            Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab,
                            but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures
                            have beat us to it.

                              a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.
                            In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently
                             face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution.
